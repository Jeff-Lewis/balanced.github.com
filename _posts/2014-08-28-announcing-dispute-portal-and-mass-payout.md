We recently released a couple of new features to Balanced Dashboard to make it easier for marketplaces to handle disputes and make a large number of payouts.

### Dispute Portal

Handling credit card disputes can be a messy affair, but at Balanced we’re trying to make this process as painless as possible for our customers.  Starting today you’ll be able to fight chargebacks directly via the dashboard without bothering to contact support thanks to our new dispute portal!

We’ve tried to keep layout changes to a minimum for you, and to that effect the process has been kept as simple as possible.  Once you’ve logged in to the Balanced dashboard simply click on the Disputes tab as you normally would, and then select the individual dispute that you’d like to protest.  You’ll then see a blue button labelled “Attach docs”, which will let you leave a detailed description of why you’re fighting the dispute, as well as the ability to attach any supporting documentation that you have.  Remember, the more documentation that you have, the better!  If you want to accept the dispute without protest, you won’t need to do anything; once the date to reply to the dispute by has passed it will automatically update to “lost”, effectively refunding your customer.

Once you’ve clicked Submit the documentation and any notes that you’ve left will be sent out to the credit card issuer, and the state of the dispute will update from “Pending” to “Submitted” to indicate that it’s already been addressed.   Once the credit card issuer renders a decision the status will then update to “Won” or “Lost”.

### Mass Payout

In another effort to streamline things on the Balanced dashboard, we’d also like to announce the introduction of a new masspay feature!  You’re now able to mass import payouts to the dashboard directly from a csv in order to send out large numbers of credits to your customers and sellers.  We’ve included step-by-step instructions of how to do this directly in your dashboard, so please review this by clicking on the “Import Payouts” link on your dashboard directly next to the transaction export link.
